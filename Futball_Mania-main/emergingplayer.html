                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    Canada The most complete striker in CONCACAF helped Lille stun star-studded Paris Saint-Germain to win the French title last season. Since then, his goals and relentless attacking game boosted Canada to their first World Cup appearance since 1986, with
                    David and the Reds capable of making noise in Qatar.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    As FIFA's top-ranked team, the Red Devils are one of the tournament favorites, and De Bruyne is their best player. The Manchester City midfielder has been to two previous World Cups, including in 2018, when Belgium reached the semis. He’s good enough
                    to lead his country all the way this time.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    If El Tri are to progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup for an eighth consecutive time, their most consistent goal scorer will help get them there. Mexico are lucky to have Jimenez at all after he suffered a potentially career-ending broken skull
                    in 2020.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    The most dangerous target striker on the planet — in January, Lewandowski was named FIFA’s best player for 2021 — lived up to that title in March, when he scored the goal that ultimately sent Poland to Qatar with a win over Sweden in Europe’s playoffs.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    After his successful penalty kick in a shootout won the African Cup of Nations for his country over Egypt in February, Mane repeated the feat in March — again against the Pharaohs and Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah — to send Senegal to the World Cup
                    for the third time and second in a row.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    Mbappe notched four goals four years ago in Russia and became the only teenager besides Pelé to score in a World Cup final. After Les Bleus hoisted the trophy, Mbappe was named the best young player at the 2018 World Cup. What will he do for an encore
                    in Qatar?

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    Messi will be 35 by the time Qatar 2022 kicks off, making it likely that it will be the GOAT’s last dance on the grandest stage — and his final chance to lead Argentina to their first World Cup title since Diego Maradona captained the Albiceleste to glory
                    in 1986.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    It has been 20 years since Brazil won the World Cup. But with Neymar now squarely in the prime of his career (and blue-chip understudies such as 21-year-old Vinicius Junior emerging), the record five-time champs could add a sixth star in No. 10’s third
                    trip to the tournament.

                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    Captain America is one of the few remaining holdovers from the U.S. team that — through no fault of Pulisic’s — failed to qualify four years ago. Now Pulisic is the face of a new generation of bona fide USMNT stars determined to make their names on the
                    global stage.
                </p>

                    Cristiano Ronaldo, 37, Portugal
                </h1>
                <p class=" lh-sm">
                    Considering Ronaldo's age, this will surely be the fifth and final World Cup for the all-time top scoring man in international soccer. CR7 and Portugal were lucky to make it at all, avoiding Italy in March’s playoff and easily beating North Macedonia
                    to qualify — with Ronaldo assisting on the berth-clinching goal.
